          <h1>INTERESTS</h1>
          <span class="square"></span>
          <p>I am mostly interested in photography, reading and trade market. Photography has always been something that interests me. As a child, I would always take random pictures from my parents phone. As growing up and travelling to different place, I started to take pictures from my phone and editing them. Later on, I was gifted a camera from my parents which allowed me to take professional pictures. I love reading! As a child reading was something i’d run away from. It didn’t really interest me. But as growing up, reading enhanced my learning in different ways. It allowed me to read book about things that caught my attention. For instance, due to the pandemic trading was something that interested me. To enhance my learning about trading, I would read books related to trading which allowed me to learn different skills. Since I’m talking about trading, it’s been something I recently got engaged in. I’d always see people around me trade stocks or currencies which always caught my attention. In the start of 2020, I learned about different tradings and encouraged myself to do some trades. After learning about how to trade, I started trading; i didn’t always make profit off of my trades, but most of the time, I did!</p>

          <h1>SKILLS</h1>
          <span class="square"></span>
          <p>I have strong tech skills and can create visually appealing graphics for any occasion. I applied this skill to help my friend create a wedding planner website as I was bored at home! Problem-solving is something that I am strong in and have applied that skill countless times. I am am very social with people I am comfortable, I’d act very weird and strange at time, but its all fun! I have organization skills which help me better myself. I plan everything ahead of time keeping my schedule organized. I also can’t stand my room or closet being messy, I need to clean it up the second I make a mess!</p>

          <h1>TECH EXPERIENCE</h1>
          <span class="square"></span>
          <p>I have had a lot of tech experience over the past few years. Since I was interested in photography, I’d always design or photoshop pictures I would take of place. It allowed me to develop different skill which may help me in the future. As a student, I have took courses outside of school related to tech. I have learned html and css, python, javascript; in which I am not so good at and will be learning c++. I plan on becoming a software engineer and I believe that learning coding and having tech experience would help me further grasp knowledge about my chosen career path. </p><br><br>
