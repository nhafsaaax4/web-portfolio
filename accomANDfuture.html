          <p>Software Engineer is a person who operates systems, networks and database with systematic method with computer language. This is a path I am considering in the future since I have a tech experience.
            Technology has played a huge role as of the 21st century allowing the computing power to increase and networking prices to decrease. There is a high demand of software engineers as it is a technology based feild. </p><br><br>

          <h1>ACCOUNTING</h1>
          <span class="square"></span>
          <p>Accounting is the method of documenting financial transactions relating to a company. The financial process involves outlining, reviewing and reporting these transactions to state authorities, regulators and tax collectors. Accounting is also something I want to take as it is numbers related. My uncle was an Chartered Public Accountant in Australia and as a child, i’d always look up to him. Ever since then, accounting was one of the two things I want to pursue as a future career.</p><br><br>

          <span class="square"></span>
          <p>Some of my accomplishments within school are my grades. In the past I never bothered to do better and my grades were always in the 70’s. Ever since grade 10, I knew I had to do good in school for the better of my own future as it will help me get into the university’s I want to go to. My grades have gotten way better than they were and I am so much more motivated by my mom. I’m always ready to face a new challenge. Some of my accomplishments outside of school are the activities I did outside of school; coding, tutoring kids, workshops and etc. These challenged me to be a better person and engage with different people from different culture and learn a bit about them. </p><br><br>
